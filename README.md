# Fandjango

## About

Facebook applications are simply websites that load in iframes on Facebook. Facebook provide documents loaded
within these iframes with various data, such as information about the user accessing it or the Facebook Page
it is accessed from. This data is encapsulated in [signed requests](http://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/signed_request/).
Fandjango parses signed requests, abstracts the information contained within and populates the request object accordingly.

## Disclaimer

This is a development branch. If you want to use Fandjango, you're probably looking for a [stable release](https://github.com/jgorset/fandjango).

## Documentation

Fandjango documentation will be moved to [Read The Docs](readthedocs.org) following the release of version 4.
